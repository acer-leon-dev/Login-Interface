# Login-Interface
A repository for my C++ login interface project.

This is a terminal application that functions as command prompt and an interface for a service 
that allows its users to sign up, log in and sign out of specific accounts with designated
information such as usernames, emails and passwords. Passwords can be changed.

Commands are listed in commands.md
